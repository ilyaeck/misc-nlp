To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P\\xe1vlovna burst out: \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\\u2019t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.

Cut out a simile candidate out of each sentence; optionally: replace \"likes\" and \"ases\" with a \"comparator\". \n",

Find those that at least 98% similar and appear multiple times (over 10) across the corpus - those are thrite similes (or common grammatical constuctions containing 'like' or 'as' that we missed during cleaning). Build a corpus of trite similes. With a testing set, repeat all steps up to fuzzywazzy. Then, instead of fuzzy matching candidates across the testinf set, fuzzy match them with the trite similes corpus. Highlight (tag) if a match is found.  \n",

In a new text, repeat all steps up to the last one and then find new n-grams in the dictionary. If the new n-grams are among the most frequently met n-grams in the corpus, these n-grams constitute trite similes. Then use them as a trite similes corpus and compare to the testing set as described in the approach 1. \n"
