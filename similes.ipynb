    "#take a big corpus with trite similes (The Daily Mail, http://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/, or a pulp fiction book), prepare clean sentences, traverce throug the corpus sen by sen, POS-tagging each and looking for sentences containing prepositions \"like\" and \"as\" (tag = \"IN\") and exclude \"as soon as, as well as, as usual, such as, as of yet, as much, like that, like this..\" ((alternatively, use dependency parser to accurately cut out a phrase. but it's a pain and may be an overkill)) Add these sentences to a target corpus. Cut out a simile candidate out of each sentence; optionally: replace \"likes\" and \"ases\" with a \"comparator\". \n",
    "#approach 1:\n",
    "#Use fuzzywazzy to do fuzzy matching of the simile candidates across the corpus. Find those that at least 98% similar and appear multiple times (over 10) across the corpus - those are thrite similes (or common grammatical constuctions containing 'like' or 'as' that we missed during cleaning). Build a corpus of trite similes. With a testing set, repeat all steps up to fuzzywazzy. Then, instead of fuzzy matching candidates across the testinf set, fuzzy match them with the trite similes corpus. Highlight (tag) if a match is found.  \n",
    "#approach 2: \n",
    "#Sort words in each set alphabetically. Then build an n-gram counter (may be plot a histogram) - a dictionary with an n-gram as a key and how many times is appears in the corpus as a value. In a new text, repeat all steps up to the last one and then find new n-grams in the dictionary. If the new n-grams are among the most frequently met n-grams in the corpus, these n-grams constitute trite similes. Then use them as a trite similes corpus and compare to the testing set as described in the approach 1. \n"
